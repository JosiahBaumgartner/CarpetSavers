      <h2 id="Carpet-Cleaning">Carpet Cleaning</h2>
      <p> First, we cover your carpets with a pre-treatment which loosens dirt
        and debris and prepares your carpets to be thoroughly cleaned. <br>
        <br>
        We then use our top of the line Prochem Everest HP steam cleaner to dig
        deep into your carpets, removing all the dirt, grime and germs. Our
        truck mounted system allows us to fully extract the buildup from your
        carpets and remove it completely from your home without risk of spilling
        large reservoirs of disgusting water like rental machines or shop vacs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, we offer a protective treatment and/or deodorizing enzyme
        treatment. The application of a carpet protectant helps the carpets
        themselves last longer by making your carpets more resistant to stains,
        dirt and spills and our deodorizing treatment directly fights and breaks
        down odors from pets, kids and more! <br>
        <br>
        Carpet Savers <u>guarantees</u> that we will do a far better job than
        any DIY or rented carpet cleaner. We will leave your home much cleaner
        and healthier than is possible with such cleaners. </p>
      <h2 id="Tile-Grout-Cleaning">Tile &amp; Grout Cleaning</h2>
      <p> Using our special tile wand, we are able to clean the
        dirtiest of tile and grout! First we pretreat the tile and
        grout to allow the dirt and grime time to loosen up before our machine
        uses highly pressurized 250°F detergent strips away years of grime and
        dirt buildup. <br>
        <br>
        We not only deep clean your grout, removing the buildup and sterilizing
        it, we can also re-seal your grout. Re-sealing the grout ensures a
        longer life for your floor and a longer lasting clean. </p>
      <h2 id="Air-Duct-Cleaning">Air Duct Cleaning</h2>
      <p> Carpet Savers trusts only the RamAir advanced, closed circuit, air
        duct cleaning system to give your home the cleanest possible air ducts
        and dryer vents. The RamAir self-propelled jet hose moves quickly
        through your duct system blowing the dirt, dust and debris loose and
        backward as it passes. When retracted, the hose continues to blow back,
        forcing the junk in your ducts back with it. <br>
        <br>
        The RamAir vent cover provides a sealed and closed exit point for the
        dust, dirt and other particles, allowing them to only get sucked into
        the vacuum hose and out of your home – nothing escapes into your home as
        we clean your air ducts. </p>
      <h2 id="Carpet-Restretching"> Carpet Restretching </h2>
      <p> You’ve probably seen the traditional method of laying and stretching
        carpets, a knee kick pad. While this is an effective, industry standard
        method, Carpet Savers goes above and beyond to provide you with a
        superior, longer lasting, <strong>life time warrantied</strong> carpet
        stretch. We use a power stretcher to lock your carpet into its most snug
        and optimal position before trimming any excess carpet and reinstalling
        it. <br>
        <br>
        One common issue with restretched carpet are creases that have developed
        in the carpet. Many lesser carpet stretchers can stretch and reset the
        carpet, but the crease can be left in the fibrous base just above the
        padding. Not so with Carpet Savers! After we power stretch and reset the
        carpet, we go can to to work with our Rotovac to completely eliminate
        the appearance of the crease, making your carpet tight, smooth and
        looking reborn. </p>
      <h2 id="Upholstery-Cleaning"> Upholstery Cleaning </h2>
      <p> We offer professional furniture odor and spot removal services at
        affordable rates. Our cleaning methods are tough on stains but gentle on
        fabrics so we'll have your upholstery and furniture looking and smelling
        great in no time. <br>
        <br>
        Once we’ve removed the stain(s) and thoroughly cleaned your furniture we
        can apply a protectant that will help extend the life of your furniture
        and make the cleaning we just did last longer. </p>
      <h2 id="Carpet-Repair">Carpet Repair</h2>
      <p> One of the most common issues requiring carpets needing repair are pet
        damage issues. We love our furry friends, trust us we’ve got a few at
        Carpet Savers, but having an animal in the house can be less than kind
        to your carpets. Pets can dig or tear holes in the carpets, pull them up
        and chew on them or wreak many other forms of havoc on carpets. That’s
        where Carpet Savers comes in. Our expert workmen can do a patch repair
        on damaged carpet to restore it to its original look. And just like our
        stretching services, we guarantee and warranty the stability and hold of
        the patch for life.* Typically we can use carpet remnants to achieve
        this but if you don’t have remnants we can pull a sample from a closet
        or other hidden area. Once the repair is done we can help blend the
        replacement with a cleaning. <br>
        <br>
        *While we guarantee and warranty the strength and stability of the
        patch, we cannot guarantee the look or blend. Unfortunately not all
        patches can look seamless due to differences such as level of wear or
        even slight color differences in carpet batches. Steam cleaning and the
        passage of time will usually help the patch to blend into a uniform
        look.&nbsp; Most often, patching the carpet does in fact look better
        than damaged carpet, but we’ll give you an honest assessment and
        recommendation so you can make the best choice for your home. </p>
      <h2 id="Carpet-Installation">Carpet Installation</h2>
      <p> Are your carpets just so worn down that you need to replace them? Is
        carpet cleaning no longer a viable option for your home or office? Then
        call Carpet Saver and let’s chat about our carpet installation services
        and options. If you're worried about the price for new carpet
        installation, don’t be. Carpet Savers offers highly competitive pricing
        and works with trusted carpet retailers that will offer you a discount
        when you mention that Carpet Savers sent you their way! <br>
        <br>
        Not sure what to do with that old carpet and padding to make way for
        your brand new carpet? Carpet Savers will haul away your old carpet and
        carpet padding as part of the installation process if you need it. <br>
        <br>
        You might be concerned that bringing in huge rolls of carpet and padding
        along with all the tools and extra people in your home might cause
        unexpected damage. Rest assured, we want your experience with Carpet
        Savers to be one that makes you recommend us to your family, friends and
        neighbors so the care and protection of your home is at the top of our
